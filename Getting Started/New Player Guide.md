Welcome to Godly Adventures! This guide will help you get started on your epic journey.

## 1. Character Creation

*   When you first join the game, you'll be prompted to create your character.
*   Choose your character's appearance (more customization options can be unlocked later!).
*   Select your starting ability (don't worry, you can unlock more as you progress).

## 2. Tutorial Area

*   You'll begin in the **Training Grounds**, a safe zone designed to teach you the basics.
*   Follow the on-screen prompts and interact with the NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to learn about movement, combat, and using your abilities.
*   Complete the tutorial quests to earn your first rewards!

## 3. Your First Realm: Elysium Fields

*   Once you've completed the tutorial, you'll be ready to venture into **Elysium Fields**, the first main realm.
*   Explore the environment, battle monsters, and discover hidden treasures.
*   Talk to NPCs with exclamation marks (!) above their heads to receive quests.

## 4. Leveling Up

*   Gain experience points (XP) by defeating enemies and completing quests.
*   When you level up, you'll earn stat points to improve your character's attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, etc.).
*   You'll also unlock new abilities and talents as you reach certain level milestones.

## 5. Basic Tips

*   **Collect everything!** Resources are crucial for crafting and upgrading.
*   **Don't be afraid to experiment.** Try out different abilities and find a playstyle that suits you.
*   **Join a Clan.** Teaming up with other players makes the game more fun and helps you tackle challenging content.
