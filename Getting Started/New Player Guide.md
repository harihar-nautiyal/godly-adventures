*   Select your starting ability (don't worry, you can unlock more as you progress).

## 2. Tutorial Area

## 3. Your First Realm: Elysium Fields

*   Talk to NPCs with exclamation marks (!) above their heads to receive quests.

## 4. Leveling Up

*   When you level up, you'll earn stat points to improve your character's attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, etc.).
*   You'll also unlock new abilities and talents as you reach certain level milestones.

## 5. Basic Tips

*   **Collect everything!** Resources are crucial for crafting and upgrading.
