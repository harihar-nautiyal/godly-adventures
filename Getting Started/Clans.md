# Clans

Clans are a great way to team up with other players, conquer challenging content, and forge lasting friendships in Godly Adventures.

## Joining a Clan

1. **Open the Clan Menu:** Press the "P" key (default) to open the Clan menu.
2. **Browse Clans:** Look through the list of existing Clans. You can often see their level, member count, and a brief description.
3. **Send a Request:** If you find a Clan you'd like to join, send a join request. The Clan's leader or officers will review your request.
4. **Create Your Own Clan:** If you prefer to lead, you can create your own Clan! You'll need to choose a name and meet any requirements (e.g., a certain level or Gold cost).

## Clan Benefits

*   **Teamwork:** Easily group up with Clan members for quests, dungeons, and other activities.
*   **Socialization:** Chat with your Clan members using the Clan chat channel.
*   **Clan Buffs:** Some Clans may offer buffs to their members, such as increased experience gain or damage.
*   **Clan Bank:** Some clans may have a shared bank to store items and resources for members to use.
*   **Clan Events:** Participate in Clan-specific events and competitions.
*   **Clan Raids:** Team up with your Clan to tackle challenging, high-reward raids.

## Clan Roles

*   **Leader:** The founder or designated leader of the Clan. Has full control over Clan settings, membership, and ranks.
*   **Officer:** Appointed by the Leader, Officers can help manage the Clan, invite/kick members, and organize events.
*   **Member:** A regular member of the Clan.
*   **\[Custom Ranks]:** Leaders may be able to create custom ranks with specific permissions.

## Clan Leveling

*   Clans can level up by completing Clan activities, such as defeating bosses together or participating in Clan events.
*   Higher Clan levels may unlock new benefits and features for members.

## Clan Wars (If Applicable)

*   Some games have a Clan War system where Clans can compete against each other for rewards and prestige.
*   If Godly Adventures has Clan Wars, this section would detail the rules, rewards, and how to participate.

*Remember to be respectful and helpful to your Clan members. Teamwork and cooperation are key to success!*
