**Concept:** A balanced fighter proficient in melee combat, with increasing strength, resilience, and tactical options as they level up.

- **Level 1: Basic Attack (Weapon)**
    
    - **Description:** Standard melee attack using equipped weapon. Damage scales with weapon quality.
    - **Rationale:** Every character needs a basic attack. This is the foundation of their combat.

    - **Description:** Briefly increases defense, reducing incoming damage by a percentage.
    - **Rationale:** Introduces a tactical option for survivability, allowing players to mitigate damage in tough situations.
- **Level 3: Power Strike**
    
    - **Description:** A powerful melee attack that deals increased damage but has a short cooldown.
    - **Rationale:** Provides a burst damage option, adding strategic depth to combat.
- **Level 4: Taunt**
    
    - **Description:** Forces nearby enemies to focus their attacks on the Warrior for a short duration.
    - **Rationale:** Introduces a "tanking" element, allowing the Warrior to protect weaker allies or control the flow of combat.
- **Level 5: Whirlwind Attack**
    
    - **Description:** Attacks all nearby enemies in a radius around the Warrior, dealing moderate damage.
    - **Rationale:** Adds an area-of-effect (AoE) attack, useful for crowd control and dealing with multiple enemies.
- **Level 6: Battle Cry**
    
    - **Description:** Increases the attack power of the Warrior and nearby allies for a short duration.
    - **Rationale:** Introduces a buffing ability, enhancing the Warrior's role as a team player and providing strategic synergy with other characters.
- **Level 7: Iron Skin**
    
    - **Description:** Significantly increases the Warrior's defense and resistance to status effects for a short duration.
    - **Rationale:** Provides a powerful defensive cooldown, allowing the Warrior to withstand heavy attacks or survive dangerous situations.
- **Level 8: Charging Strike**
    
    - **Description:** Dashes towards a target enemy, dealing damage and briefly stunning them.
    - **Rationale:** Adds mobility and crowd control, allowing the Warrior to close gaps, interrupt enemy actions, or reposition quickly.
- **Level 9: Berserker Rage**
    
    - **Description:** Greatly increases attack speed and damage but reduces defense for a short duration.
    - **Rationale:** A high-risk, high-reward ability that maximizes damage output but leaves the Warrior vulnerable, creating exciting and impactful moments in combat.
