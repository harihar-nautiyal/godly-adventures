Uranus, the primordial god of the sky, is a powerful and distant figure in Greek mythology. He represents the heavens themselves, the vast expanse above the earth. His abilities should reflect this cosmic nature, encompassing control over the sky, weather, and celestial bodies.

Uranus's abilities are focused on manipulating the sky, summoning celestial phenomena, and exerting cosmic power.

**Uranus's "Main Weapon":**

Uranus is not typically depicted with a specific weapon. He _is_ the sky. However, we can choose a symbolic focus:

1. **The Sky itself:** This emphasizes his inherent connection to the heavens.
    
2. **A Staff or Scepter made of celestial materials:** This could be made of starlight, clouds, or meteoric iron.
    

**Recommendation:**

**Using the sky itself as his "main weapon" is the most fitting.** This reinforces his identity as the personification of the heavens and allows for more visually impressive abilities. For example, he could summon lightning with a gesture, create windstorms with a roar, or call down meteors with a wave of his hand.

**Visuals and Flavor:**

- **Blues, Whites, and Purples:** Colors associated with the sky, clouds, and celestial phenomena.
- **Clouds, Stars, and Lightning:** Visual effects that evoke the atmosphere of the heavens.
- **Wind Sounds and Celestial Harmonies:** Sound effects that create a sense of awe and wonder.
- **Shifting Clouds and Glowing Constellations:** Visual effects that represent his control over the sky and celestial bodies.

By focusing on these thematic elements, you can create a truly awe-inspiring and majestic representation of Uranus, highlighting his role as the primordial god of the sky and a powerful cosmic force.
