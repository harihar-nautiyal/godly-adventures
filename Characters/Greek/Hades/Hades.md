The Greek god of the underworld, is a stern and imposing figure. He is not the god of death (that's Thanatos), but rather the ruler of the realm of the dead. His abilities should reflect his dominion over the underworld, including control over the dead, manipulation of shadows, and the power to inflict fear and despair.

Hades's abilities focus on control, debuffs, summoning, and area-of-effect damage, reflecting the oppressive and inescapable nature of his realm.
