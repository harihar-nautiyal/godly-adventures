# Enemies

The world of Godly Adventures is filled with a variety of enemies, from common creatures to powerful bosses. Understanding their strengths, weaknesses, and abilities is crucial for survival.

## Enemy Types

*   **Normal Enemies:** These are the most common enemies you'll encounter. They typically have lower health and less complex attack patterns.
*   **Elite Enemies:** Stronger versions of normal enemies, often with increased health, damage, and special abilities. They may have a distinct visual indicator, such as a glowing aura.
*   **Mini-Bosses:** Powerful enemies that are more challenging than elites but less difficult than full bosses. They often guard valuable treasures or important locations.
*   **Bosses:** Extremely powerful enemies with unique mechanics and attack patterns. They usually require a group of players to defeat and drop rare and valuable loot.
*   **World Bosses:** Bosses that spawn in the open world at specific times or locations. They are typically very difficult and require a large number of players to conquer.
