# Report a Bug

Thank you for helping us improve Godly Adventures!

If you've encountered a bug or issue in the game, the best way to report it is by joining our official Discord server and posting in the **#bug-reports** channel.

## [Join the Godly Adventures Official Discord Server!](https://discord.gg/F33uujfmhj)

**Why Report Bugs on Discord?**

*   **Faster Response:** Our development team and community moderators are active on Discord and can respond to bug reports more quickly.
*   **Direct Communication:** You can directly communicate with the developers and other players to provide more details about the bug.
*   **Community Support:** Other players may have experienced the same issue and can offer workarounds or solutions.
*   **Stay Updated:** Get updates on bug fixes and patches in real time.

**How to Report a Bug on Discord:**

1. **Join our Discord server** using the link above.
2. Go to the **#bug-reports** channel.
3. **Describe the bug** as clearly and concisely as possible. Include the following information:
    *   **What happened?** Describe the issue you encountered.
    *   **Where did it happen?** Specify the location in the game (e.g., realm, area, quest).
    *   **When did it happen?** Provide the date and time (if possible).
    *   **Steps to reproduce:** If you can reliably reproduce the bug, list the steps you take to make it happen.
    *   **Screenshots or videos:** If possible, provide visual evidence of the bug.
    *   **Your Roblox username:** So the team can help you if needed.

**Please Note:**

*   Do not use the #bug-reports channel for general chat or questions. Use the appropriate channels for those purposes.
*   Search the channel to see if your bug has already been reported before posting.
*   Be respectful and patient. Our team will do their best to address your issue as soon as possible.
