# Currencies

    *   **Obtained by:**
        *   Completing quests
        *   Defeating enemies
        *   Selling items to merchants
        *   Looting chests
    *   **Used for:**
        *   Purchasing items from merchants (weapons, armor, consumables, etc.)
        *   Repairing gear
        *   Basic crafting
*   **Godly Shards:** Rare and powerful currency used for enhancing abilities and crafting legendary items. (See [Godly Shards](Gameplay/Godly%20Shards) page for more details)
*   **\[Realm-Specific Currency]:** Some realms may have their own unique currency that can be used to purchase special items or access certain areas within that realm.
    *   Example: **Olympian Coins** (Olympus), **Shadow Gems** (Realm of Shadows)
*   **\[Premium Currency Name] (e.g., Divine Gems):** A premium currency that can be purchased with real money (Robux).
    *   **Obtained by:**
        *   Purchasing with Robux

        *   Convenience items (experience boosts, inventory space, etc.)
        *   Exclusive items or features

## Currency Exchange

*   Some games allow players to exchange certain currencies for others. For example, you might be able to trade Gold for a specific realm currency at a special merchant.

## Currency Caps

*   There may be a limit to how much of each currency you can hold at one time.

## Tips for Managing Currency

*   **Prioritize your spending:** Focus on purchasing essential items and upgrades first.
*   **Don't be afraid to sell unwanted items:** If your inventory is full, sell items you don't need to earn Gold.
*   **Look for deals:** Some merchants may offer discounts on certain items.
*   **Save up for important purchases:** If you're aiming for a specific high-cost item, be patient and save your currency.
